This is a starting point for javascript applications developed by the SEAS Applications Development Team. It provides a basic React starter in `src/client`, with a backend built on nestjs in `src/server`.

## Quick Start

This setup uses `docker` and `docker-compose` for local development, as defined in `docker-compose.yml`. Installation instructions for various platforms can be found [here][docker].

Node is also required.

You'll also need to copy `.env-example` to `.env` and fill in the appropriate values. For local development the default values in `.env-example` should do.

Then to start the project, run:

```sh
npm install
docker-compose up
```
